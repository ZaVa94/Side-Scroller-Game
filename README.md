# Side-Scroller-Game
A simple side scrolling game created for Computing Tech for Sport and Play at the University of Colorado at Boulder

This project was completed using Apple's IDE Xcode. All code was written in Swift and consists of 3 main files. "GameScene.swift" handels all actions, characters, and environment controls within each scene.  "GameViewController.swift" handels all changes to the environment, mainly sizing of the sprite.  "Levels.swift" contains the information relative to each scene within the game.

The purpose of the game is to navigate all scenes by scrolling to the right edge of the screen.  The text in each scene prompts the user to take certain actions that will influence the ending that the player is presented with at the end of the game.
